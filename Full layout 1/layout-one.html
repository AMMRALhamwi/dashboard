                <h2>WHAT'S IT LIKE TO TRAVEL IN TURKEY</h2>
                <p>At the point where Europe and Asia collide, it is Turkey's transcontinental culture-clash, its east-west spice-mix of influences, flavours, cultures, religions and histories, that makes this country so intoxicating. This is a land of sensorial richness, in its bazaars and mosques, its food and arts; of exoticism and romance, from its Ottoman palaces to fairy-tale Cappadocia. Its beauty spots are equally diverse. Inland there are otherworldly landscapes and ancient wonders to be explored, once the playgrounds of Cleopatra and Mark Antony, Caesar and Alexander the Great, and yet they are little visited compared with similar sites in Italy and Greece. In summer, Turkey's exceptionally beautiful Turquoise Coast is plied by gulets sailing on their Blue Voyages from the Aegean to the eastern reaches of the Mediterreanean, dropping anchor to swim in bays of crystal-clear water, and taking long lunches in fishing villages, at blue-painted tables and chairs framed with canopies of pink bougainvillaea, where life has gone on unchanged for thousands of years. To help you find these spots, we've rounded up the most beautiful places to visit in Turkey.

            <h3>Hagia Sofia, Istanbul</h3>
            <p>There are many outstanding landmarks in Istanbul, with the city displaying a staggering array of architectural styles across its many buildings which is why there are many cultural attractions in Turkey

                The Byzantine and Ottoman empires have both controlled Istanbul in the past and it is these two societies that have had the biggest impact on its development.</p>

            <h3>Xanthos, near Antalya</h3>
            <p>The ruins of the ancient city of Xanthos, once the capital of Lycia, are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a brilliant place to explore when you're on holiday in Turkey.

                The remains of the city are easily accessible from some of the country's top seaside resorts, too, so it's a good choice if you want to inject a bit of culture into your beach break.</p>
